            <p>
              Personal Training involves hiring a Personal Trainer to help a
              client meet their fitness goals, through the knowledge, skills,
              and abilities personal trainers possess. A personal trainer is a
              fitness professional who designs exercise programs and instructs
              exercise to help people achieve their fitness goals, which will
              often include weight loss, improving sports performance, or
              managing a health condition. They do this by working with people
              on a one-to-one basis and in a group setting.
